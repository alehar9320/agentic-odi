# CLI Reference

The `agentic-odi` CLI is a [`Typer`](https://github.com/fastapi/typer)-based
command-line interface for working with Agentic ODI without a chat UI. It
provides an interactive chat mode plus version, update, and data commands. Data
commands are **local-first**: they read and write a SQLite store with no server
required, and switch to a remote MCP server with `--backend mcp`.

Install the workspace first if you have not already:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

## Launching

```bash
python -m agentic_odi_cli --version   # print the Agentic ODI version
python -m agentic_odi_cli --help      # show available options and commands
python -m agentic_odi_cli             # start interactive chat in a terminal (help when piped)
```

A console script is also installed, so `agentic-odi --version` works the same way.

## Global options

| Option | Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--backend auto\|local\|mcp` | `AGENTIC_ODI_BACKEND` | `local` | Run in-process against SQLite, call a remote MCP server, or (`auto`) try local first and fall back to MCP. |
| `--db PATH` | `AGENTIC_ODI_DB` | `~/.agentic-odi/odi.db` | Store path for the `local` backend. |
| `--mcp-url URL` | `AGENTIC_ODI_MCP_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/mcp` | Server URL for the `mcp` backend. |

Data commands print readable tables and blocks by default; add `--json` for
machine-readable output. Diagnostics go to stderr and failures exit non-zero
(`0` success, `1` error, `2` usage error).

## Interactive chat

`agentic-odi chat` (or simply `agentic-odi` in a terminal) starts an
offline-first interactive REPL. The session always boots, even when no model or
MCP server is reachable — a yellow warning is shown for any unavailable service,
and free-text messages return a friendly nudge until you connect.

```bash
agentic-odi chat
agentic-odi chat --model local-tools-model --mcp-url http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Thinking does not need the Studio or its sidecar. While the first token is on
its way, a dim `thinking…` sits on the prompt line and is erased when the reply
starts, so a cold model reads as work rather than a hung session. When the
model exposes its reasoning (`reasoning_content` or `reasoning`, as vLLM,
Ollama, and DeepSeek do), it is printed dimmed on stderr as `thinking › …`:
the answer on stdout stays clean, and the thinking is never replayed as
conversation history.

### Connection settings

The chat resolves settings in priority order:
**CLI flag → environment variable → persisted profile → built-in default.**

| Variable | Default | CLI flag |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTIC_ODI_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8001/v1` | `--base-url` |
| `AGENTIC_ODI_MODEL` | `local-tools-model` | `--model` |
| `AGENTIC_ODI_API_KEY` | `local` | `--api-key` |
| `AGENTIC_ODI_MCP_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/mcp` | `--mcp-url` |

The **persisted profile** is stored at
`~/.config/agentic-odi/llm_profile.json`. You can create or update it from
within the session using `/connect`.

### Slash commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/status` | Show current model, base URL, and MCP server with connection status |
| `/connect` | Launch the wizard: provider → URL → API key → model → MCP URL → save |
| `/model <name>` | Hot-swap to a different model mid-session |
| `/mcp <url>` | Reconnect to a different MCP server mid-session |
| `/tools` | List the MCP tools the assistant can call |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation history (keeps connection) |
| `/exit` | Quit the session (also `/quit`) |

### /connect wizard

`/connect` walks you through configuring your LLM provider interactively:

1. **Provider** — choose `openai`, `anthropic`, `local`, or `other`
2. **Base URL** — preset filled for known providers; override freely
3. **API key** — input is hidden via `getpass`
4. **Model** — sensible default per provider
5. **MCP URL** — defaults to the current value
6. **Save to profile?** — writes `~/.config/agentic-odi/llm_profile.json` so settings persist across sessions

The wizard can be cancelled at any step with Ctrl-C.

> [!NOTE]
> Chat is the only CLI mode that needs an LLM endpoint. The `customer-outcomes`
> and `connectors` commands keep working without one.

## Manage Jobs, Steps, and desired Outcomes

Every ODI entity has the same create/read/update/delete surface in the CLI and
the MCP server. Jobs hold Steps (the Job Map) and desired Outcomes; deleting a
Job cascades to both.

```bash
# Jobs
agentic-odi jobs add --name "Onboard a customer" --description "First 30 days"
agentic-odi jobs list
agentic-odi jobs get <job-id>
agentic-odi jobs update <job-id> --name "Onboard a new customer"
agentic-odi jobs delete <job-id> --yes

# Steps (Job Map)
agentic-odi steps add --job-id <job-id> --name "Prepare environment" --order 1
agentic-odi steps add --job-id <job-id> --name "Execute" --order 5 --stage execute
agentic-odi steps list --job-id <job-id>
agentic-odi steps get <step-id>
agentic-odi steps update <step-id> --order 2
agentic-odi steps delete <step-id> --yes

Capture a desired or customer outcome before adding a step. Use `--allow-empty-job-map`
only when you intentionally need to stage a map before capturing outcomes.

# Desired Outcomes
agentic-odi desired-outcomes add --job-id <job-id> --statement "Minimize the time it takes to get a working environment" --importance 8 --satisfaction 4
agentic-odi desired-outcomes list --job-id <job-id>
agentic-odi desired-outcomes get <outcome-id>
agentic-odi desired-outcomes update <outcome-id> --satisfaction 6
agentic-odi desired-outcomes delete <outcome-id> --yes
agentic-odi desired-outcomes export --job-id <job-id> --format csv > outcomes.csv
agentic-odi desired-outcomes export --job-id <job-id> --format json | jq '.[].opportunity_score'
agentic-odi desired-outcomes evaluate "Minimize the time to ship when onboarding"

# One-screen report: job header, phase coverage, biggest opportunities
agentic-odi summary <job-id>
agentic-odi summary <job-id> --top 3 --json
```

`--importance` and `--satisfaction` (1–10) are now required on `add`. `evaluate`
checks a statement against the ODI format rules before saving.

`summary` shows how many of the eight job-map phases the Job covers, which are
still missing, and the underserved outcomes (score above 10) in descending
order. `--top` caps that list; `--json` returns the same data for a script.

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output. `export` writes to
stdout only — CSV has one row per outcome with the same fields the table shows
plus `job_id` and `step_id`, so it pipes straight into a spreadsheet or `jq`.

## Propose and review outcomes

`candidates` turns a quote into proposed outcomes, then records a person's
decision on each. Extraction **proposes only**; a candidate becomes an Outcome
only when it is accepted, and that write goes through the same outcome validator
as any other. See [Interviews](interviews.md) for the full walkthrough.

```bash
# Propose outcomes from one quote (nothing is accepted).
agentic-odi candidates extract --quote-id <quote-id> \
  --quote "Minimize the time it takes to onboard when a customer signs up." \
  --job-id <job-id>

# Review what was proposed.
agentic-odi candidates list --job-id <job-id>
agentic-odi candidates list --status proposed --json
agentic-odi candidates show <candidate-id>

# Record a person's decision: accept, reject, or merge.
agentic-odi candidates accept <candidate-id> --importance 9 --satisfaction 4
agentic-odi candidates accept <candidate-id> --importance 9 --satisfaction 4 \
  --statement "Minimize the time it takes to onboard a customer when they sign up."
agentic-odi candidates reject <candidate-id> --reason "names a solution, not an outcome"
agentic-odi candidates merge <candidate-id> --merged-into <outcome-id>
```

`accept` creates **exactly one** Outcome and links its evidence. An
already-decided candidate is refused rather than re-accepted, so a retry cannot
double-write. `reject` requires a reason and keeps it. `merge` folds a
near-duplicate into an existing Outcome and creates no outcome.

## Load the sample workspace

`demo` loads a labelled corpus so you can see a filled canvas before you have
research of your own. Every row it writes carries `origin="demo"`; loading is
additive and a second load is a no-op. `clear` removes only the `origin="demo"`
rows and never touches your own data.

```bash
agentic-odi demo load            # 1 job, 8 steps, 40 outcomes, 12 evidence rows
agentic-odi demo load --json     # the same counts, machine-readable
agentic-odi demo clear --yes     # remove only the sample rows
```

## Evidence

Evidence is research captured from connectors (or entered by hand) and linked to
a Job, Step, or desired Outcome. Records can later be promoted into ODI
artifacts — the bridge from research to the model, without hand-copying.

```bash
# Capture a record by hand
agentic-odi evidence add \
  --source-name "interview" --source-kind manual \
  --name "Support lead" \
  --content "Setup takes two days for every new engineer" \
  --job-id <job-id>

# Read and delete
agentic-odi evidence list --job-id <job-id>
agentic-odi evidence list --job-id <job-id> --json
agentic-odi evidence get <evidence-id>
agentic-odi evidence delete <evidence-id> --yes

# Promote into the ODI model
agentic-odi evidence promote <evidence-id> --to job
agentic-odi evidence promote <evidence-id> --to outcome --job-id <job-id>
```

`connectors ingest --job-id <job-id>` maps every evidence-bearing record in the
ingested batch into evidence in one step.

## Schema, scoring, and guidance

```bash
agentic-odi schema            # canonical JSON schema for every ODI entity
agentic-odi score 8 2         # ODI opportunity score → 14.00
agentic-odi evaluate "Minimize the time to ship when onboarding"  # outcome-format check
agentic-odi evaluate --json "Minimize the time to ship when onboarding"
agentic-odi guidelines        # the ODI stage-by-stage guide
agentic-odi capabilities      # what the assistant can do
agentic-odi capabilities --json   # machine-readable manifest
agentic-odi capabilities tools  # tool names only
agentic-odi spine             # which stages of the quote-to-measurement spine exist
agentic-odi spine --json      # the same, machine-readable
```

`evaluate` returns the same verdict the `evaluate_outcome` MCP tool does, so the
check works with or without a running server.

`capabilities` groups every tool by effect (read/write/destructive) and by ODI
stage. `capabilities --json` emits the full machine-readable manifest.
`capabilities tools` lists tool names only.

`spine` reports which stages of the quote → candidate → outcome → score → brief →
decision → bet → measure pipeline are implemented in this build, and names the
issue that owns each stage that is not. Until those stages land it prints
"nothing yet" — it never fabricates a number to fill a gap.

`store` reports the local store's schema version and whether it is openable:

```bash
agentic-odi store            # store path and schema version
agentic-odi store --json     # the same, machine-readable
```

It opens the store through the same path every command uses, so a refusal here
is the refusal you would hit elsewhere — a database newer than this build is
refused naming both versions and the upgrade command, not a bare
"incompatible".

## Inspect settings and feature flags

```bash
agentic-odi settings flags list
agentic-odi settings flags get experimental_connectors
agentic-odi settings flags set experimental_connectors true
agentic-odi settings flags reset
```

`experimental_connectors` gates the `connectors` group (`add`, `health`,
`ingest`). `auto_update` gates startup auto-update checks. `advanced_metrics`
gates detailed metrics output in `desired-outcomes evaluate`. `developer_mode`
gates raw MCP trace debugging.

## Manage your profile and run setup

```bash
agentic-odi profile show
agentic-odi profile set domain "acme.test"
agentic-odi profile path
agentic-odi setup       # alias for profile; runs the first-run baseline wizard
```

`profile show` prints the baseline as JSON. `profile set` updates a baseline
field. `profile path` prints the baseline file path. `setup` is an alias for
`profile` that runs the interactive first-run baseline wizard on first launch.

## Manage Customer Outcomes

Customer Outcomes link customer value to business value. The `local` backend
writes to the shared SQLite store with no server required; add `--backend mcp`
to route through a running MCP server (`python -m agentic_odi_mcp_server`). The group is also
available under its historical name `outcomes`.

```bash
# Add a Customer Outcome
agentic-odi customer-outcomes add --job-id <job-id> \
  --direction minimize --unit "time" --object "to resolve setup errors" \
  --statement "Minimize the time to resolve environment setup errors when onboarding" \
  --importance 8.8 --satisfaction 3.2 \
  --category cost_reduction \
  --business-statement "Saves engineering hours and reduces early churn"

# Attach value metrics: repeatable JSON objects
agentic-odi customer-outcomes add --job-id <job-id> \
  --direction minimize --unit "time" --object "to resolve setup errors" \
  --statement "Minimize the time to resolve environment setup errors when onboarding" \
  --importance 8.8 --satisfaction 3.2 --category cost_reduction \
  --business-statement "Saves engineering hours" \
  --value-metric '{"name":"first response","direction":"minimize","unit_of_measure":"minutes","importance":7,"satisfaction":3}'

# List outcomes (optionally filtered, or as JSON)
agentic-odi customer-outcomes list
agentic-odi customer-outcomes list --job-id <job-id>
agentic-odi customer-outcomes list --json

# Get, update, delete
agentic-odi customer-outcomes get <outcome-id>
agentic-odi customer-outcomes update <outcome-id> --importance 9.0
agentic-odi customer-outcomes delete <outcome-id> --yes

# Compute an ODI Opportunity Score (top-level, also under the group)
agentic-odi score 8 2
agentic-odi outcomes score 8 2
```

`score` applies the ODI opportunity formula,
`importance + max(importance - satisfaction, 0)`.

Set `AGENTIC_ODI_MCP_URL` (or `--mcp-url`) to point to a non-default server when
using `--backend mcp` (default: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`).

## Connectors

The `connectors` group manages external MCP integrations. See
[External Connectors](connectors.md) for presets, the connector registry, and
ingest behavior.

```bash
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors catalog
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors add mcp --preset github
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors list
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors list --json   # name, kind, url, enabled per connector
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors health --name github
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors ingest --name github
python -m agentic_odi_cli connectors ingest --name github --dry-run   # preview only
```

## Updates

`odi update` checks for and installs a new binary release. Auto-update is on by
default; disable it with `--no-update` for one run or
`AGENTIC_ODI_NO_UPDATE=1` globally. See [Installation](installation.md).
